Our program takes a sentence as input and returns the part of speech of each word, as well as other useful information. This idea has been done before, but it is hard to understand the output
it gives you, which limits its usefulness.

To run the program, type python lang/run.py into the ubuntu command prompt (open one by pressing Alt-T
or the plus button by the files).

After a few seconds the command prompt should say "Building Parser!" If not, then the server was most likely started
incorrectly and python lang/run.py should be retyped.

Due to the large amount of information our program handles, it takes around 45 seconds for the program to finish loading. 
Please be patient with the command prompt.

After loading, a message like    Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)   will appear. Clicking the
link and then "open" will lead to the website. An alternate way of accessing the website is by typing in 
langserver-erikferragut.c9users.io:8080 . If using this method, be sure that the number at the end of the URL matches 
the number at the end of "Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/"

Once you have accessed the webpage, type an English sentence into the input box and click submit, for example, 
"I love coding!". This will cause a table analyzing the parts of speech to appear. To read more about us and our
mission, click the link in the upper left had corner labeled "about"; click "home", located in the same place, to 
return to the main program.

After you are finished viewing the website, turn off the server by returning to the command prompt and clicking
CTRL - C on the keyboard twice.


Thank you for viewing our program, and we hope you enjoy it!
