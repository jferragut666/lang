To run the program, type python lang/run.py into the ubuntu command prompt (open one by pressing Alt-T
or the plus button by the files).

After a few seconds the command prompt should say "Building Parser!" If not, then the server was most likely started
incorrectly and python lang/run.py should be retyped.

Due to the large amount of information our program handles, it takes a while for the program to finish loading. Please
be patient with the command prompt.

After loading, a message like    Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)   will appear. Clicking the
link and then "open" will lead to the website. An alternate way of accessing the website is by typing in 
langserver-erikferragut.c9users.io:8080 . If using this method, be sure that the number at the end of the URL matches 
the number at the end of "Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/"

After you are finished viewing the website, turn off the server by returning to the command prompt and clicking
CTRL - C on the keyboard twice.


Thank you for viewing our program, and we hope you enjoy it!
