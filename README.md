Ethan progress:
https://spacy.io/docs/api/ is good and has a list of spaCy functions under the "classes" header to the left
https://spacy.io/docs/api/annotation is especially good. It has a good explanation for 'lemma' and likely (still in progress) has the parts of speech acronyms (tags) used
https://nicschrading.com/project/Intro-to-NLP-with-spaCy/ has some syntax and common placeholders we used and is good
https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC99T42/tagguid1.pdf is the full guide of acronyms. The page bugs out sometimes, and reload it if it does. I have a screenshot of the correct guide, but it 
    will not let me copy it. I think the problem is with part of the www.ldc.upenn.edu website, the catalog part.
