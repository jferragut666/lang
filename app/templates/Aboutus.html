    <h4> Steven, also a sophomore, has been coding for a while, in a variety of languages, and  hopes to eventually earn a career in the field of computer science </h4>
    <h4> Erik Ferragut is our TechPro, and has spent a lot of time helping to teach us how to code. Without him this project would not have been possible. </h4>
