    <h4> Our mission is to provide a user-friendly way to help people learn English by helping learners understand the different Parts of Speech. </h4>
    <h4> We have seen a part of speech tagger using spaCy, but it does not translate the part of speech acronyms used. </h4>
    <h2> About us </h2>
    <h4> We are a high school CodeTN team. This is our first year doing this event, but we hope to do it in many more years to come. </h4>
    <h4> Nathan and Jacob are sophomores, brothers and our oldest members. They have been coding since they were eight years old. </h4>
    <h4> Ethan and Andrew are also brothers. Ethan is a sophomore and Andrew a freshman. <br>They have been coding for a couple of years, and are eager to learn more about the wonders of code. </h4>
    <h4> Steven, also a sophomore, has been coding for a while, in a variety of languages, and  hopes to eventually earn a career in the field of computer science </h4>
    <h4> Erik Ferragut is our TechPro, and has spent a lot of time helping to teach us how to code. Without him this project would not have been possible. </h4>
